# Window_Filter_PS
The project aims to study the efficiency of different filters using the window method. This was part of the Signal Processing course at UPB.

### Contents
- `Explicatii.docx`: documentation for the project, runs the routines which will be briefly described below with `ng = 4` and `ns = 3`;
- `faza1_2.mlx`: Matlab script for phases 1 and 2 of the project, looks at different windows and their properties;
- `faza3.mlx`: Matlab script for phase 3 of the project, studies the best filter found at `faza1_2.mlx` and looks at its parameters (this example being a Kaiser window);
- `faza_4.mlx`: Matlab script for phase 4 of the project; makes a ranking of all the filters generated by the mentioned windows in the files;
- `lanczoswin.m`: function to generate a Lanczos window;
- `freq_cut_calc.m`: function to calculate the cutoff frequency;
- `check_PPFTI.m`: function to set the tolerance in order to limit the ripple effect;
- `best_filter_4.m`: function to find the best parameters of a specified window when given a cutoff frequency;
- `PS_PRJ_1_Faza_xx.mlx`: functions to generate unique inputs for testing, code provided in the course for validation.

### Additional notes
The filter found at phase 4 described in `faza_4.mlx` is approximatively 60% accurate to the ideal filter, as per evaluation done at the course.
